# neuropulse
NeuroPulse is a graphical Python framework for red team operations. It centralizes command-line tools for Wi-Fi attacks (Aircrack-ng), exploitation (Nmap, Metasploit), and IoT analysis. Core features include a process manager to control tasks, a configuration file for customization, and an HTML report generator.

NeuroPulse is a graphical framework built in Python and Tkinter, designed to centralize and streamline the workflows of red team operations and penetration testing. It acts as a unified control panel for a variety of common command-line security tools, allowing an operator to launch scans, execute attacks, manage processes, and log all activity from a single, intuitive interface.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Unified GUI:** A clean, tab-based Tkinter interface for managing disparate tools.
* **Cross-Platform Launcher:** Intelligently launches tools in a new terminal on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
* **Process Manager:** Track and kill any background process launched by NeuroPulse from a dedicated tab.
* **External Configuration:** Easily customize default settings (interfaces, tool options) via a `neuropulse_config.json` file.
* **Session Logging & Reporting:** All actions are logged to the screen and a session file, which can be exported as an HTML report.

### Tool Integration
* **üì∂ Wi-Fi Attacks:**
    * Network discovery (`airodump-ng`)
    * Deauthentication attacks (`aireplay-ng`)
    * Beacon Floods (`mdk4`)
    * WPS Attacks (`reaver`)
    * WPA/WPA2 cracking (`aircrack-ng`)
    * Guided Evil Twin setup (`airbase-ng`)
* **üì° BLE & Zigbee:**
    * Bluetooth LE reconnaissance (`bettercap`)
    * Zigbee PCAP analysis (`tshark`)
* **üí• Exploitation & Network Analysis:**
    * Automated CVE suggestion (`nmap` + `searchsploit`)
    * Metasploit RC file generation and launch (`msfconsole`)
    * Captured hash classification viewer
* **üõ†Ô∏è Utilities:**
    * Simple binary fuzzer ("BitFlip Engine") with undo capabilities.
    * HTML report generation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

NeuroPulse is a wrapper and requires several external command-line tools to be installed and available in your system's PATH.

**Essential Tools:**
* Python 3.8+
* `nmap`
* `aircrack-ng` suite (`airodump-ng`, `aireplay-ng`, `aircrack-ng`, `airbase-ng`)
* `tshark` (from the Wireshark suite)
* `msfconsole` (Metasploit Framework)
* `searchsploit` (Exploit-DB)
* `bettercap`
* `mdk4`
* `reaver`
* `hcxdumptool` (Optional, for PMKID attacks)

For Debian-based systems (like Kali Linux), you can install most of these using:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install nmap aircrack-ng wireshark metasploit-framework exploitdb bettercap mdk4 reaver -y
